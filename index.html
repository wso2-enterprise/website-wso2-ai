    text: "What is agent identity and why is it needed?"
    a: "Agent identity uniquely identifies an autonomous AI agent to control and audit its behavior. It enables:  
      • **Access Control:** Define authorized actions  
      • **Auditability:** Trace and attribute behavior  
      • **Authentication:** Verify legitimacy before granting privileges.  
      As AI agents act autonomously, identity becomes the foundation of secure, accountable operation."

              <p class="answer-text">Without proper IAM, autonomous AI agents pose significant security and compliance risks. The transition to the agentic AI era necessitates a proactive and fundamental rethinking of enterprise IAM—it's no longer just about managing who logs in, but about governing what can act autonomously, why it can act, and how its actions are audited.</p>

              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li><strong>Unauthorized Data Access:</strong> Agents can access sensitive data beyond their authorization due to misconfigurations or exploiting loopholes, which leads to breaches, intellectual property (IP) theft, and privacy violations.</li>
                <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Agents with limited permissions can exploit vulnerabilities to gain elevated access (e.g., read-only to administrative), potentially compromising systems or manipulating data.</li>
                <li><strong>Impersonation Attacks:</strong> AI agents can be exploited to impersonate users or systems, causing malicious actions to be misattributed or deceiving other systems into granting unauthorized access.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Non-Compliance:</strong> Operating AI agents without modern IAM contradicts regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), risking fines, legal repercussions, and reputational damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Untracked Actions:</strong> Lack of robust IAM creates "blind spots," as agent actions may not be logged or audited, hindering monitoring, incident detection, and compliance efforts.</li>
